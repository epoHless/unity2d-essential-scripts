# WELCOME TO MY UNITY 2D ESSENTIAL SCRIPTS

Inside the project you can find various plug-and-play scripts,
meaning you just have to drop them on your gameObject to make them work.

As of for now, in this project you can find scripts for:

Movement:
- Topdown Movement;
- Platform Movement with jump (and double jump);
- Drag and Shoot Movement;
- Grid based Movement.

Dialogues:
- TypeWriter Effect for text;
- Conversation between multiple characters;
- Scriptable object used to easily create dialogues.

There are many more i'm planning to add to the repository, i'll work on it for as much as i have time.
